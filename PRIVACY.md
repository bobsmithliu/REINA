Privacy Policy

Using this bot (Discord unique user name: R.E.I.N.A. #3681, "this bot") means that you have read and understood this document.

The developer of this bot has made every possible effort to minimize data collection. However, to keep this bot operable responsively, some non-sensitive data will be collected in a non-permanent way. No data is ever stored permanently.

This bot will collect your messages and user information (meta-data included) sent to 22/7 Discord server (http://discord.gg/NxZ3W7Z, "this server") to a server operated by Amazon Web Services in its cache: a non-permanent storage system, for command processing. The bot only collects the most recent 1000 messages sent in this server. Your messages and information will be deleted from the cache after a short period of time. 

If, in any way, you are not comfortable with how your data is collected and used, please immediately contact this bot's developer: Skk#0135.
